## Usage

     [lister "location" "mode" "style" "reverse"]
     
| Parameter | Function |
| :---: | :--- |
| location | If empty path of current file or points *from the root* to the folder to list. |
| mode | display mode<br/> default 0 = empty: `TitlePreview` or `Title` as link.<br/>1: Additional teaser display upt to `[--more--]`and `readmore`-link.<br/>If `[--more--]` is missing, the whole file is displayed. |
| mode | If `1` some css style is added to increase the font-size of the title (link) to 120% of standard inside the list. |
| reverse | If `r` list direction is Z-A instead A-Z of pages (depending on file name) |

Lister creates a Linklist to all files (exept Status "hidden") of a folder.

## Title Replacement

`TitlePreview` is an *alternative* Headline instead of the standard headline of a page. It has to be set up in the header area of the yellow file.

**TitlePreview Example**

```
title: This is the regular title
titlePreview: This is an alternative title
Layout: wiki
â€¦
```

This can useful for replacement of (too) long titles or for better explanation of content in the generated list.

## Example
Creates a list of titles (titlePreview, if available):

    [lister /faq/]

Creates a list of titles (titlePreview, if available) with increased font size and adds the teaser of the file below the title(Preview):

    [lister /faq/ 1]

Encloses the list of the first example with `<div class="myclass">` instead of `<div class="lister">`:

    [lister /faq/ - myclass]
    
Reverse previous sample:

    [lister /faq/ - myclass r]
